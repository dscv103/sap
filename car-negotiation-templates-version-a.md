## Email Template 1 — Initial OTD Offer + Request for Itemized Quote

**Subject:** Offer: $[OTD] out-the-door for VIN [VIN] — quick written quote?

Hi [Name] — hope you’re doing well.

I’m planning to purchase a new [Year Make Model Trim] by the **end of next week** and I’m reaching out for a simple, written out-the-door quote.

**Vehicle:** VIN [VIN] / Stock [STOCK] — [color/options if needed]  
**My offer:** **$[OTD] out-the-door** (inclusive of all dealer fees, taxes, and registration).

If you can accept, great. If not, please reply with your best **itemized OTD** so I can compare offers apples-to-apples.

To keep us aligned, please include:
1) Selling price  
2) Itemized rebates/incentives (list each)  
3) Doc fee and any other dealer fees (itemized)  
4) Title/registration estimate  
5) Sales tax line item  
6) **Total OTD**

**Incentives/financing:** I believe I qualify for [list incentives]. I also have outside financing lined up, but if you can confirm I qualify for **[0% APR offer, if applicable]** and whether it’s combinable with the incentives above, I’m open to using manufacturer financing.

**Add-ons:** Please show **no dealer-installed add-ons** included, or list any add-ons clearly as **optional** (declinable).

**Timeline:** I’m aiming to complete the purchase by the **end of next week**. If the numbers work, I’m happy to move quickly.

Thank you,

## Email Template 2 — Request Signed Buyer’s Order / Worksheet (Lock Terms)

**Subject:** Next step: please email a signed buyer’s order / worksheet for VIN [VIN]

Hi [Name] — thank you.

Before I schedule pickup, could you please email a **signed buyer’s order** (or detailed purchase worksheet) showing:

1) **VIN [VIN]** with the full description (year/make/model/trim/color/options)  
2) **Itemized OTD breakdown** matching our agreed **$[OTD]**:
   - Selling price: $____  
   - Less rebates/incentives: −$____ (itemize each)  
   - Doc fee: +$____  
   - Title/registration/handling: +$____  
   - Sales tax: +$____  
   - **Total OTD: $[OTD]**
3) If financing through you: APR, term, amount financed (no need to focus on monthly payment)  
4) **Add-ons** shown as either:
   - “No dealer-installed add-ons,” or  
   - Any add-on listed with price and clearly marked **OPTIONAL / buyer may decline**
5) Dealer/manager signature

Once I receive it, I’ll review, countersign, and we can schedule pickup for **[date/time near end of next week]**. If a deposit is required to hold the vehicle, please confirm the amount and that it’s refundable (and send the receipt by email).

Thanks again,  
[Your Full Name]
