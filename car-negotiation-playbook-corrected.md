## ⚠️ CRITICAL MARKET CONTEXT (January 2026)

**You have MORE leverage than usual:**
- New vehicle sales forecast DOWN 2.4% in 2026 (Cox Automotive)[web:267][web:270]
- Dealers have HIGHER inventory than 2023-2024[web:267][web:273]
- Month-end (Jan 31) approaching = quota pressure on dealers[web:102][web:107]
- **Use this to negotiate aggressively**[web:267][web:282]

- This is **SUPERIOR** to any credit union rate - 0% costs you $0 interest over 5 years

**CRITICAL:** Incentives may be **either/or** (cash OR 0% financing, not both). Confirm with dealer which combination you qualify for.[web:280][web:287]

- **OR tiered rates:** 1.9% / 36mo, 2.9% / 48mo, 3.9% / 60mo, 4.9% / 72mo[web:291]

**CRITICAL:** 0% APR for only 36 months = $1,500+/month payments on $55K vehicle. If you need longer term, compare 3.9%/60mo dealer rate vs. your credit union rate.[web:291]

## SECTION 2: CORRECTED PRICING TARGETS

## SECTION 3: PRE-NEGOTIATION PREPARATION

### Step 1: Verify Current Incentives (THIS WEEK)

**DO NOT rely on this playbook's incentive amounts beyond January 2026.** Incentives change monthly and vary by:
- Specific trim level[web:280]
- VIN production date (2024 vs 2025 model year)
- Region (some offers are regional only)
- Eligibility (loyalty/conquest/military/Costco)

**Check CURRENT incentives at:**
1. **Jeep.com/incentives** (official - enter zip 70115)[web:244][web:284]
2. **Chevrolet.com/current-deals** (official - enter zip 70115)[web:236]
3. **Edmunds.com/[vehicle]/deals** (updated weekly)[web:283][web:287]
4. **KBB.com/[vehicle]/deals-incentives** (updated weekly)[web:233][web:280]

---

### Step 2: Secure Pre-Approval Financing

**Get rate quotes from Louisiana credit unions:**
- LouisianaUSA Federal Credit Union
- Pelican State Credit Union
- Member's Choice Credit Union
- Campus Federal Credit Union

**HOWEVER:**
- If 0% APR is available from manufacturer, **SKIP your credit union** and take the 0% financing[web:280][web:233]
- 0% for 60 months (Jeep) saves you ~$5,000-$6,000 vs. a 5% credit union loan
- 0% for 36 months (Silverado) saves you ~$2,500-$3,000 vs. a 5% loan

**Pre-approval is still useful for:**
- Negotiating leverage ("I have 4.5% from my credit union - can you beat that?")[web:124][web:138]
- Backup if 0% isn't available or you don't qualify

---

### Step 3: Research Market Inventory & Pricing

**Before making offers, check:**

1. **Average Transaction Price** (what others are ACTUALLY paying):
   - Edmunds.com "True Market Value"[web:282]
   - Consumer Reports "What People Are Paying"[web:282]
   - TrueCar average paid price[web:282]
   - **Use this as your baseline - aim $1,000-$1,500 below average**[web:282]

2. **Days-to-Turn** (how long has the VIN been on the lot?):
   - Call dealer, ask "How long has Stock# ____ been in inventory?"[web:271]
   - Units sitting 60+ days = more negotiating room[web:271]

3. **Regional Inventory Levels:**
   - Search Cars.com, AutoTrader.com for your configuration within 100 miles
   - If 50+ units available = you have leverage[web:249][web:267]
   - If 5 units available = less leverage[web:249]

4. **Dealer Holdback & True Cost:**[web:265][web:268][web:271]
   - Holdback is typically 2-3% of MSRP (varies by manufacturer)[web:135][web:166]
   - "True dealer cost" = Invoice − Holdback − Manufacturer-to-dealer incentives[web:265][web:271]
   - **Dealers can't consistently sell below holdback and survive** (average profit per vehicle is $2,300)[web:264][web:265]
   - Your goal: Get them to $1,000-$2,000 above true cost = aggressive but fair[web:264][web:282]

---

### Step 4: Identify Target Dealers

**Contact 8-10 dealers** (NOT 20 - diminishing returns):[web:266]

**Jeep dealers within 100 miles of 70115:**
- Ray Brandt Jeep (Harvey, LA)
- Leson Jeep (Metairie, LA)
- Premier Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram (Slidell, LA)
- All Star Jeep (Baton Rouge, LA)
- Jeep of the Northshore (Covington, LA)
- Plus Mississippi Gulf Coast dealers (Gulfport, Biloxi)

**Chevrolet dealers within 100 miles of 70115:**
- Banner Chevrolet (New Orleans, LA)
- Hixson Automotive (Slidell, LA)
- All Star Chevrolet (Baton Rouge, LA)
- Ross Downing Chevrolet (Hammond, LA)
- Plus Mississippi Gulf Coast dealers

**Target the Sales Manager or General Manager directly:**[web:34][web:36]
- Call dealership, ask for "Internet Sales Manager" or "Sales Manager" name and email
- Skip generic "sales@dealer.com" addresses[web:36]

---

## SECTION 4: THE CORRECTED EMAIL STRATEGY

### Why "Best Price" Emails FAIL[web:266]

**Dealer feedback from Reddit /r/askcarsales:**
> "Saying 'best price' just essentially annoys people... the listing price is supposed to be good and essentially their best already."[web:266]

> "Email lead conversion rate of 9% is considered solid. Most dealers get 50+ 'best price' emails per week and ignore them."[web:266]

**The problem:** Asking for "best price" makes dealers:
- Think you're not serious (just shopping)[web:266]
- Unwilling to give their lowest price first[web:266]
- Assume you'll keep asking for lower even after they quote[web:266]

**The solution:** Make a **specific, researched offer** that forces them to respond with accept/counter/decline.[web:266][web:282][web:286]

---

### CORRECTED EMAIL TEMPLATE (Offer-Based Approach)

**Subject:** Cash offer — [Year Make Model Trim] — VIN/Stock ____ — 70115 buyer — ready by [date]

**Body:**

> Hi [Sales Manager Name],
>
> My name is [Your Name] and I'm ready to purchase a new **2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Limited 4x4** [or **2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT with Duramax engine**] by [specific date - within 7 days].
>
> I've identified **VIN [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]** (or Stock# ____) on your lot and would like to make an offer.
>
> **My Offer: $[YOUR TARGET OTD] out-the-door**
>
> **Offer Breakdown:**
> - Selling price: $[MSRP minus incentives you qualify for]
> - Manufacturer incentives I qualify for:
>   - [For Jeep: "$7,500 Grand Cherokee L cash allowance + $2,500 customer cash + $750 bonus cash + $500 military/first responder" = list YOUR specific ones][web:280][web:287]
>   - [For Silverado: "$3,000 customer cash + $1,000 bonus cash + $1,250 Costco + $500 first responder" = list YOUR specific ones][web:233][web:283]
> - Doc fee: $195
> - OMV title/registration/handling: $100
> - Orleans Parish sales tax (9.45%): $[calculated on selling price]
> - **Total OTD: $[YOUR OFFER]**
>
> **Financing:** I have pre-approval at [X.XX]% from my credit union, but I'm aware of:
> - [For Jeep: **0% APR for 60 months** offer - if this is still available, I'll take manufacturer financing][web:280]
> - [For Silverado: **0% APR for 36 months** offer - if available and I qualify, I'll take manufacturer financing][web:233]
>
> Please confirm:
> 1. Whether you can accept my offer of $[YOUR OTD] or provide a counteroffer
> 2. Whether I qualify for the 0% financing and if it's combinable with the cash incentives I listed
> 3. If counteroffering, please provide an itemized OTD breakdown
>
> I'm also reaching out to [3-4] other dealerships with similar offers. If you can accept my offer or come within $[500-1000] of it, I'll purchase from you on [specific date] and provide excellent survey scores.
>
> **Timeline:** I can complete this transaction on [specific date within 7 days].
>
> Thank you,
> [Your Full Name]
> [Phone]
> [Email]

---

### Why This Email Works Better:[web:266][web:282][web:286]

1. **Specific offer** (not "what's your best price?") - forces a response[web:266][web:282]
2. **Shows you've done research** (lists exact incentives, calculates tax) - signals you're serious[web:282]
3. **Itemizes your math** - dealer can easily see if you're reasonable or unrealistic[web:143][web:282]
4. **Creates urgency** (ready within 7 days, contacting multiple dealers)[web:17][web:23]
5. **Leaves room for counteroffer** ("come within $500-1000") - not ultimatum[web:282]
6. **Mentions survey scores** - dealers value CSI/survey bonuses[web:61]
7. **Acknowledges 0% financing** - shows you understand trade-offs[web:280][web:233]

---

## SECTION 5: EXPECTED RESPONSES & YOUR COUNTERS

### Response 1: "Your offer is too low / We can't do that"

**Your reply:**
> "I understand. Can you share what OTD price you CAN work with? Please provide an itemized breakdown showing selling price, fees, tax, and total OTD so I can compare it to my other quotes. If you're within $[amount] of my offer, I'm confident we can make a deal."

**Strategy:** Get them to counteroffer with specifics[web:266][web:282]

---

### Response 2: "Come in to discuss / We need to see you in person"

**Your reply:**
> "I appreciate that, but I'm conducting initial negotiations remotely for efficiency. Multiple dealers are responding to my email offers, and I'll visit the dealer who provides the most competitive written OTD quote. What OTD price can you offer for VIN [XXX]?"[web:36][web:103]

**Strategy:** Don't visit until you have a signed buyer's order[web:208][web:212]

---

### Response 3: "Let's focus on monthly payment"

**Your reply:**
> "I'm focused on total out-the-door price first. Once we agree on OTD, we can discuss financing terms. What's your OTD price for VIN [XXX]?"[web:20][web:35]

**Strategy:** Never negotiate monthly payment - dealers manipulate rate/term[web:20][web:35]

---

### Response 4: "We accept your offer!" (Too easy = you offered too much)

**Your reply:**
> "Excellent! Please email me a signed buyer's order showing:
> 1. VIN [XXX] with exact description
> 2. Itemized OTD breakdown matching $[YOUR OFFER]
> 3. Statement that all add-ons are optional
> 4. Your signature or authorized manager signature
>
> Once received, I'll countersign and schedule pickup for [date]."[web:208]

**Strategy:** Lock it in writing immediately[web:208][web:212]

---

### Response 5: "That price requires 0% financing / You can't combine cash + 0%"

**Your reply:**
> "Understood - can you provide two quotes:
> 1. OTD with 0% APR financing (showing which cash incentives are sacrificed)
> 2. OTD with cash purchase (showing all cash incentives applied)
>
> I'll compare total cost of ownership and decide which makes more sense."

**Strategy:** Calculate which is better (0% usually wins if available)[web:280][web:233]

---

### Response 6: Counteroffer $2,000-$3,000 above your offer

**Your reply:**
> "Thanks for the counteroffer of $[THEIR OTD]. I've received quotes from [Dealer X] at $[LOWER OTD]. If you can match $[MIDPOINT BETWEEN YOUR OFFER AND THEIRS], I'll purchase from you on [date] and won't contact other dealers."[web:26][web:61]

**Strategy:** Play dealers against each other[web:26][web:61][web:106]

---

## SECTION 6: THE BUYER'S ORDER REQUIREMENT

### Non-Negotiable Rule: No Visit, No Deposit Until Signed Buyer's Order

Once a dealer agrees to your target OTD, **do not visit or put down money** until you receive:[web:185][web:208][web:212]

**Email request:**

> "Excellent - thank you for agreeing to $[OTD]. Before I schedule pickup, please email a **signed buyer's order** (or detailed purchase worksheet) showing:
>
> 1. **VIN [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]** with exact description (year/make/model/trim/color/options)
> 2. **Itemized OTD breakdown** matching our agreed price of $[XX,XXX]:
>    - Selling price: $____
>    - Less manufacturer rebates/incentives: −$____ (itemize each)
>    - Plus doc fee: +$____
>    - Plus OMV title/reg/handling: +$____
>    - Plus sales tax (9.45%): +$____
>    - **Total OTD: $____**
> 3. **Financing terms** (if using dealer financing):
>    - APR: ____%
>    - Term: ___ months
>    - Amount financed: $____
>    - Monthly payment: $____
> 4. **Add-ons section** showing either:
>    - "No dealer-installed add-ons" OR
>    - Each add-on listed with price and "OPTIONAL - buyer may decline" notation[web:184][web:206][web:209]
> 5. **Your signature** or authorized manager signature[web:179][web:208]
>
> Once I receive and review the signed buyer's order, I'll:
> - Countersign and return it
> - Provide a refundable deposit via credit card (if required - please confirm amount and refund terms)
> - Schedule pickup for [date/time]
>
> Thank you!"

---

### Why This Is Dealer-Proof:[web:185][web:208][web:212]

1. **Signed buyer's order is a binding contract**[web:208][web:212]
2. **Prevents bait-and-switch** (different VIN, added fees, changed trade value)[web:181][web:184]
3. **Locks in add-ons as optional** (FTC CARS Rule requires disclosure)[web:184][web:206][web:209]
4. **Gives you legal recourse** if dealer changes numbers at delivery[web:208]
5. **You haven't invested time/money** visiting until deal is documented[web:208]

---

### Deposit Guidelines (If Required):[web:180][web:183][web:186]

**Only if dealer requires a deposit to hold the vehicle:**

1. **Make it explicitly refundable in writing**[web:186]
   - Email confirmation stating: "Deposit of $____ is fully refundable if: (a) vehicle condition differs from buyer's order, (b) financing not approved at agreed terms, or (c) dealer fails to honor agreed OTD price"[web:186]

2. **Use a credit card** (not debit/check)[web:186]
   - Better fraud protection and chargeback rights[web:186]

3. **Get receipt via email immediately**[web:186]

4. **Never pay non-refundable deposit** before inspecting the vehicle[web:183][web:186]

---

## SECTION 7: AT THE DEALERSHIP (DELIVERY DAY)

### What to Bring

- **Pre-approval letter** (if using outside financing)
- **Signed buyer's order** (your copy with dealer signature)
- **All email/text communications** with agreed OTD
- **Checkbook or wire-transfer confirmation** (if paying cash or down payment)
- **Driver's license**
- **Proof of insurance**

---

### Vehicle Inspection Checklist

Before signing anything:

☐ Verify **VIN matches** buyer's order exactly[web:185][web:208]  
☐ **Test drive this exact unit** (even if you've driven the model before)[web:88][web:103]  
☐ Check exterior for damage (scratches, dents, paint chips)  
☐ Check interior for damage (tears, stains, missing features)  
☐ Verify all **options listed on buyer's order are present** (sunroof, tow package, etc.)  
☐ Check tire condition and match (all 4 should be same brand/model)  
☐ Verify **odometer shows under 50 miles** (factory delivery mileage)[web:88]  
☐ Test all electronics (infotainment, cameras, sensors, climate control)  
☐ **If ANYTHING differs from buyer's order, STOP** - don't proceed until corrected[web:185]

---

### Paperwork Review (Line-by-Line)

**Take your time.** Dealers may pressure you to "sign here, here, here" quickly. **Refuse.**[web:63][web:106]

**Review these documents carefully:**

**1. Buyer's Order / Bill of Sale**[web:185][web:212]
- ☐ VIN matches
- ☐ Selling price matches agreed amount
- ☐ All incentives/rebates listed and subtracted
- ☐ Doc fee matches agreed amount ($190-$200)[web:167]
- ☐ OMV fees match agreed estimate (~$100)[web:153]
- ☐ Sales tax calculated correctly (9.45% on selling price)[web:159][web:292]
- ☐ **Total OTD matches buyer's order you received**
- ☐ **No unexpected charges added**

**2. Retail Installment Sales Contract** (if financing)[web:124][web:138][web:179]
- ☐ **APR matches** what you agreed to (0% if applicable)[web:280][web:233]
- ☐ **Term matches** (60 months for Jeep, 36 months for Silverado if 0%)[web:280][web:233]
- ☐ **Amount financed** = OTD minus down payment
- ☐ **Monthly payment** calculated correctly
- ☐ **Finance charge** = $0.00 if 0% APR[web:280][web:233]
- ☐ **No "yo-yo financing" clause** (conditional delivery subject to financing approval)[web:189]

**3. Add-Ons / Optional Products Section**[web:184][web:206][web:209]
- ☐ Should show "DECLINED" for all products you don't want
- ☐ If any products are listed, verify they were on your buyer's order
- ☐ **Common junk add-ons to DECLINE:**
  - Extended warranty (can buy later if desired)
  - GAP insurance (credit union may offer cheaper)
  - Tire/wheel protection ($500-$1,500 - rarely worth it)
  - Paint protection ($800-$2,000 - costs dealer $100-$300)[web:181][web:184]
  - Fabric protection ($500-$1,000 - you can buy Scotchgard for $20)
  - Nitrogen tire fill ($50-$200 - tires already contain 78% nitrogen)[web:206]
  - VIN etching ($200-$500 - costs $10-$20 to apply)
  - Wheel locks ($100-$200 - buy on Amazon for $30)

**4. Louisiana OMV Title Application**[web:152][web:153]
- ☐ Your name/address correct
- ☐ Sales tax calculation correct
- ☐ Title fee: $68.50[web:153]
- ☐ Handling fee: $8.00[web:153]
- ☐ Registration fee: $20-$25 for 4 years[web:153]

### Finance & Insurance (F&I) Office Warning

**The F&I manager's job is to sell you additional products.**[web:91][web:133][web:184]

**Expect these pitches:**
- Extended warranty ("What if the transmission fails after warranty expires?")
- GAP insurance ("If you total the car, you'll owe more than it's worth")
- Tire/wheel protection ("Potholes will destroy your wheels")
- Paint protection ("Bird droppings will ruin your paint")
- Fabric protection ("Stains are expensive to remove")
- Maintenance plan ("You'll need oil changes anyway")

**Your response to ALL of these:**[web:91][web:133]
> "I appreciate the explanation, but I've researched these products and I'm declining all of them today. If I decide I want extended warranty or GAP later, I can purchase them separately. Please mark all optional products as 'DECLINED' on the paperwork."

**Be polite but firm.** F&I managers make 50-80% profit on these add-ons.[web:91][web:133]

**If F&I manager says "It's already on the car" (paint protection, nitrogen, VIN etch):**[web:181][web:184][web:187]
> "I understand it's installed, but I didn't agree to purchase it. Per the FTC CARS Rule, I cannot be charged for add-ons I don't consent to. Please remove the charge from my paperwork or I'll need to walk away from this deal."[web:184][web:206][web:209]

---

### If Dealer Financing Interest Rate Differs from Quote

**If F&I shows you a higher APR than you agreed to:**[web:138][web:141]

> "The buyer's order shows 0% APR [or X.XX% APR]. This contract shows [higher rate]. Please explain the discrepancy."

**If they say "You don't qualify for 0%":**
> "I need to see documentation from [Stellantis Financial / GM Financial] showing why I don't qualify. I have a credit score of [XXX] and was told I'd qualify. If I truly don't qualify, I'll use my credit union pre-approval at [X.XX]%."[web:138][web:141]

**If they say "The rate includes dealer markup for profit":**[web:138][web:141]
> "I need you to show me the buy rate from the lender and remove any dealer markup. If you can't match my credit union rate of [X.XX]%, I'll finance through them."[web:138]

**This is negotiable.** Dealers can mark up the lender's "buy rate" by 1-3%.[web:138][web:141]

---

### Walk Away If...

**You have the power to walk away at ANY point before signing final paperwork.**[web:125][web:129]

**Walk away immediately if:**[web:125][web:129]
- OTD price on final paperwork is higher than buyer's order
- They added fees not on buyer's order (market adjustment, prep, etc.)
- They added add-ons you declined
- APR is higher than agreed and they can't justify it
- They pressure you to sign without reading
- VIN doesn't match buyer's order
- Vehicle condition differs from what you inspected
- They use high-pressure tactics ("This deal expires in 10 minutes")

**How to walk away:**[web:125][web:129]
1. Stand up calmly
2. Say: "This is not the deal we agreed to in writing. I'm not signing paperwork that differs from the buyer's order. I'll purchase elsewhere."
3. Walk toward the door
4. **If they chase you with concessions, you've regained leverage**[web:125][web:129]
5. **If they don't chase you, you avoided a bad deal**[web:125][web:129]

**Do not be emotional. Do not argue. Just leave.**[web:125][web:129]

## SECTION 8: NEGOTIATION BEST PRACTICES

### DO:

✅ Research average transaction price before making offer[web:282]  
✅ Make specific offer based on your research (not "best price")[web:266][web:282]  
✅ Contact 8-10 dealers (not 20)[web:266]  
✅ Play dealers against each other with competing quotes[web:26][web:61]  
✅ Require signed buyer's order before visiting[web:208][web:212]  
✅ Take 0% financing if available (usually beats any cash discount)[web:280][web:233]  
✅ Read all paperwork line-by-line[web:63][web:106]  
✅ Be willing to walk away[web:125][web:129]  
✅ Negotiate end of month (Jan 31 = quota pressure)[web:102][web:107]  
✅ Leverage 2026 market softness (inventory up, sales down)[web:267][web:270]

---

### DON'T:

❌ Ask for "best price" without making an offer[web:266]  
❌ Make unrealistically low offer (insults dealer, kills negotiation)[web:67][web:282]  
❌ Discuss monthly payment instead of OTD[web:20][web:35]  
❌ Visit dealership without signed buyer's order[web:208]  
❌ Trust verbal promises ("We'll take care of that")[web:106][web:109]  
❌ Sign paperwork you haven't read completely[web:63][web:106]  
❌ Accept dealer add-ons without explicit consent[web:184][web:206]  
❌ Use debit card for deposit (use credit card)[web:186]  
❌ Mention your budget or max payment[web:20][web:126]  
❌ Show desperation ("I need a car today")[web:20][web:126]  
❌ Pretend to dislike the car (dealers see through this)[web:286]

---

## SECTION 9: TEXT MESSAGE QUICK REFERENCE

**For dealers who prefer texting:**[web:37][web:40]

**Initial inquiry:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm making an offer of $[OTD] out-the-door on VIN [XXX] [Year Make Model] for a 70115 buyer. I qualify for [list incentives]. Can you accept this or counter? Contacting 8 dealers, first to accept gets my business."

**Counter-offer:**
> "Thanks. I have $[LOWER OTD] from [Dealer X]. If you can match $[MIDPOINT], I'll buy from you this week. Need itemized breakdown via email to compare."

**Buyer's order request:**
> "Great - please email signed buyer's order for VIN [XXX] showing itemized OTD $[XXX] and 'add-ons optional' statement. Will countersign and schedule pickup immediately."

**If they dodge:**
> "Appreciate that, but I need written OTD quote to compare offers. What's your OTD for VIN [XXX]?"

## SECTION 10: FINAL DECISION MATRIX

### Which Vehicle Should You Buy?

| **Factor** | **2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Limited 4x4** | **2025 Silverado 1500 LT Duramax** |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Cash Incentives** | $7,500 to $12,750 (max with all stackable)[web:280][web:287] | $4,000 to $5,750 (max with Costco)[web:233][web:283] |
| **Financing** | **0% APR for 60 months**[web:280] | 0% APR for 36 months[web:233] |
| **Target OTD** | **$42,000–$43,000** | $56,500–$58,000 |
| **Monthly Payment (0% financing)** | ~$717/mo for 60 months | ~$1,597/mo for 36 months |
| **Total Interest Paid** | **$0** (0% APR) | $0 (if 0% APR) |
| **Fuel Economy** | 18 city / 25 hwy | 23 city / 33 hwy (diesel) |
| **Seating** | 7 passengers (3 rows) | 5-6 passengers (crew cab) |
| **Towing Capacity** | 6,200 lbs | 9,500+ lbs (with Duramax) |
| **Best For** | Family SUV / carpooling / comfort | Hauling / towing / fuel efficiency / truck needs |
| **Deal Strength (Jan 2026)** | **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT** (0% for 60mo is rare + high cash incentives)[web:280][web:287] | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ GOOD (0% for 36mo, but shorter term)[web:233] |

---

### My Recommendation:

**If you can afford the higher payment:** **2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee L Limited 4x4**

**Why:**
- 0% APR for **60 months** (vs. 36 for Silverado) = lower payment[web:280]
- Higher total cash incentives available ($12,750 max vs. $5,750)[web:280][web:287]
- Target OTD is $14,000-$15,000 LESS than Silverado
- 3-row seating = more versatile
- This is an **exceptional deal** for January 2026[web:280]

**If you need truck capability:** **2025 Silverado 1500 LT Duramax**

**Why:**
- Towing capacity 50% higher (9,500+ lbs vs. 6,200 lbs)
- Diesel fuel economy 30%+ better than gas trucks
- Truck bed = hauling capability SUV can't match
- 0% for 36 months still saves you ~$2,500 vs. 5% loan[web:233]

## SECTION 12: REALISTIC OUTCOME EXPECTATIONS

### What You Can Achieve with This Strategy:

**Conservative estimate:**
- Jeep: $42,500-$43,500 OTD (vs. $44,000-$46,000 walking onto lot)[web:280]
- Silverado: $57,000-$58,500 OTD (vs. $59,000-$61,000 walking onto lot)[web:233]
- **Savings: $1,500-$3,000 compared to in-person negotiation**[web:17][web:61]

**Aggressive estimate** (if market is soft and you negotiate hard):
- Jeep: $41,500-$42,500 OTD
- Silverado: $55,500-$57,000 OTD
- **Savings: $3,000-$5,000 compared to MSRP-based deal**[web:17][web:64]

**What you WON'T achieve:**
- Jeep below $40,000 OTD (dealer loses money)[web:264][web:265]
- Silverado below $54,000 OTD (dealer loses money)[web:264][web:265]

**Dealer profit on your deal:**[web:264]
- Your target: $1,000-$2,000 dealer profit
- Dealer average: $2,300 per vehicle[web:264]
- Dealer's minimum: $500-$1,000 (below this, they'll refuse)[web:264][web:265]

**Your offer is aggressive but fair.** Dealers CAN accept it and remain profitable.[web:264][web:265][web:271]

5. **Require signed buyer's order** before visiting[web:208][web:212]
6. **Take 0% financing** when available (saves thousands)[web:280][web:233]

## FINAL NOTES

**This playbook is accurate as of January 12, 2026.**

**Incentives change monthly** - always verify current offers before making your offer.[web:280][web:233]

**Louisiana sales tax increased Jan 1, 2025** - older guides showing 4.45% state rate are outdated. Use 5% state + ~4.45-5% local = 9.45-10% total.[web:292][web:294][web:159]

**The 2026 market favors buyers** - inventory is up, sales are down, dealers need to move units.[web:267][web:270][web:273]

**You have leverage. Use it.**

Good luck!
