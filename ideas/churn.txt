 Early-warning churn scoring + save journeys
Business objective (profit lever)
Reduce voluntary closure / spend inactivity by intervening before the customer defects, preserving:

Interchange (keep spend active)
Interest (keep revolve balances)
Fee revenue (avoid closure; avoid avoidable fee disputes)

Lifecycle location
Retention (late usage/servicing boundary); triggers also work post-statement or post-decline.
Decision points & interventions
Decision points

Weekly “churn risk” score (batch)
Event-based triggers (decline spike, spend collapse, fee posting)

Interventions (graduated by cost)

Low-cost: push/email/statement message (“Use your card for X and earn Y”, autopay nudge, “you’re close to reward”)
Mid-cost: targeted category offer (e.g., 3% back groceries for 60 days)
High-cost (only for high CLV & high risk): fee credit/waiver, retention APR promo, BT offer, dedicated save call

Data required + feature ideas (only your fields)
Account

Tenure, APR, line, utilization, balance trends
Revolve indicator: balance carried / interest charged
Fee incidence: late fee, annual fee, overlimit (if present)
Delinquency status / days past due, recent cures
Rewards: earn rate, points balance, redemption activity (if available)

Txn / MCC aggregates

Spend velocity: 4/8/12-week spend, txn count
Spend trend features: % drop vs prior period; slope; volatility
Category mix shifts (e.g., grocery/gas collapse), “breadth” of categories
Auth decline rate: #declines / #auths, decline reason bucket if available
Merchant concentration (top-merchant share) and sudden change

Example churn signals you can build immediately

Spend cliff: spend down >70% vs trailing 8-week average
Decline shock: decline rate doubled week-over-week
Rate pain: interest charges rising while spend falling
Fee friction: multiple fees in 60 days + spend drop
Utilization stress: util ↑ sharply + min payment behavior deteriorates

Modeling options (2–4) + pros/cons

Survival model (Cox / discrete-time hazard)

Pros: predicts when churn happens; good for timing interventions
Cons: more complex; needs careful handling of censoring


Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM) classification

Pros: strong accuracy with non-linear patterns; handles interactions
Cons: needs explainability layer (SHAP) and drift monitoring


Regularized logistic regression (elastic net)

Pros: highly interpretable; easy governance
Cons: may miss non-linearities; slightly lower lift



Recommended: start with logistic baseline for speed + governance, then graduate to GBM if it adds meaningful lift and remains explainable.
Evaluation design
Offline

Time-based split (train: months 1–9, validate: 10–11, test: 12)
Metrics: AUC/PR-AUC, calibration, lift in top deciles, stability by tenure/product
Profit simulation: assign expected incremental profit by segment × intervention cost

Online test (preferred)

Randomized holdout within each risk band:

High risk: 70% treated / 30% control
Medium: 50/50
Low: small test or no action


Primary KPI: Δ retention (closure rate, spend-active rate)
Profit KPI: Δ interchange + Δ interest + Δ fees − Δ rewards − Δ losses − campaign cost
Guardrails: delinquency roll rates, complaints/opt-outs, over-contact rate

Deployment integration

Scoring pipeline: weekly batch score to CRM/decision engine table
Trigger service: real-time(ish) rules for decline spike/spend cliff (daily)
Orchestration: journey tool selects message/offer based on:

churn score band
value tier (proxy CLV from spend+revolve history)
risk guardrails (exclude recent delinquency worsening)


Agent desktop: if inbound call occurs, show “save prompt” with top drivers and approved offers
